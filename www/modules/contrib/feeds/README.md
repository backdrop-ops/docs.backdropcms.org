Feeds
=====

An import and aggregation framework for Backdrop. Import or aggregate data as nodes, users, taxonomy terms or simple database records.

Features
--------

* Pluggable import configurations consisting of fetchers (get data) parsers (read and transform data) and processors (create content on Backdrop).
  * HTTP upload (with optional PubSubHubbub support).
  * File upload.
  * CSV, RSS, Atom parsing.
  * Creates nodes or terms.
  * Creates lightweight database records if Data module is installed. <http://drupal.org/project/data>
  * Additional fetchers/parsers or processors can be added by an object-oriented plugin system.
  * Granular mapping of parsed data to content elements.
* Import configurations can be piggybacked on nodes (thus using nodes to track subscriptions to feeds) or they can be used on a standalone form.
* Unlimited number of import configurations.
* Export feeds importer configurations.
* Optional libraries module support.

Requirements
------------

* Job Scheduler <https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/job_scheduler>
* PHP safe mode is not supported, depending on your Feeds Importer configuration safe mode may cause no problems though.

Installation
------------

* Install Feeds, Feeds Admin UI.
* To get started quick, install one or all of the following Feature modules: Feeds News, Feeds Import, Feeds Fast News (more info below).
* Make sure cron is correctly configured <https://backdropcms.org/user-guide/setting-cron>
* Go to `import/` to import data.

SimplePie Installation
----------------------

To install the SimplePie parser plugin, complete the following steps:

  1. Download SimplePie from <http://simplepie.org/downloads>. The recommended version is: 1.3.
  2. Decompress the downloaded zip file.
  3. Rename the uncompressed folder to `simplepie`. For example rename `simplepie-simplepie-e9472a1` to `simplepie`.
  4. Move the folder to `/libraries`. The final directory structure should be `/libraries/simplepie`.
  5. Flush the Backdrop cache.
  6. The SimplePie parser should be available now in the list of parsers.

PubSubHubbub support
--------------------

Feeds supports the PubSubHubbub publish/subscribe protocol <http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/>. Follow these steps to set it up for your site.

* Go to admin/structure/feeds and edit (override) the importer configuration you would like to use for PubSubHubbub.
* Choose the HTTP Fetcher if it is not already selected.
* On the HTTP Fetcher, click on 'settings' and check "Use PubSubHubbub".
* Optionally you can use a designated hub such as <http://superfeedr.com/> or your own. If a designated hub is specified, every feed on this importer configuration will be subscribed to this hub, no matter what the feed itself specifies.

Libraries support
-----------------

If you are using the Libraries module, you can place external libraries in the Libraries module's search path (for instance /libraries). The only external library used at the moment is SimplePie.

Libraries found in the libraries search path are preferred over libraries in `feeds/libraries/`.

API Overview
------------

See "The developer's guide to Feeds": <http://drupal.org/node/622700>

Testing
-------

See "The developer's guide to Feeds": <http://drupal.org/node/622700>

Debugging
---------

Set the Backdrop config variable `feeds_debug` to TRUE. This will create a file `/tmp/feeds_[my_site_location].log`. Use `tail -f` on the command line to get a live view of debug output. You can either set it in `feeds.settings.json` in your active configuration folder or by putting `$config['feeds.settings']['feeds_debug'] = TRUE;` into the `settings.php` file.

Note: at the moment, only PubSubHubbub related actions are logged.

Performance
-----------

See "The site builder's guide to Feeds": <http://drupal.org/node/622698>

Hidden settings
---------------

Hidden settings are variables that you can define by either updating them in `feeds.settings.json` in your active configuration folder or overriding them in `settings.php` file like this example: `$config['feeds.settings']['NAME'] = VALUE;`.

Name:        `feeds_debug`  
Default:     `FALSE`  
Description: Set to TRUE for enabling debug output to `/BACKDROPTMPDIR/feeds_[sitename].log`

Name:        `feeds_importer_class`  
Default:     `'FeedsImporter'`  
Description: The class to use for importing feeds.

Name:        `feeds_source_class`  
Default:     `'FeedsSource'`  
Description: The class to use for handling feed sources.

Name:        `feeds_data_$importer_id`  
Default:     `feeds_data_$importer_id`  
Description: The table used by FeedsDataProcessor to store feed items. Usually a FeedsDataProcessor builds a table name from a prefix (feeds_data_) and the importer's id ($importer_id). This default table name can be overridden by defining a variable with the same name.

Name:        `feeds_process_limit`  
Default:     `50`  
Description: The number of nodes feed node processor creates or deletes in one page load.

Name:        `http_request_timeout`  
Default:     `15`  
Description: Timeout in seconds to wait for an HTTP get request to finish.  
Note:        This setting could be overridden per importer in admin UI: `admin/structure/feeds/<your_importer>/settings/<your_fetcher> page.`

Name:        `feeds_never_use_curl`  
Default:     `FALSE`  
Description: Flag to stop feeds from using its cURL for http requests. See `http_request_use_curl()`.

Name:        `feeds_use_mbstring`  
Default:     `TRUE`  
Description: The extension mbstring is used to convert encodings during parsing. The reason that this can be turned off is to be able to test Feeds behavior when the extension is not available.
