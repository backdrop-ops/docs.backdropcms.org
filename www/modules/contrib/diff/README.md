# Diff
The diff module is used to show differences between content revisions.
It replaces the normal Revisions tab seen when administering nodes.

Diff enhances the listing of revisions with an option to view the differences 
between any two content revisions and revert back to older versions.

Access to this feature is controlled with the 'View revisions' permission. 
The feature can be enabled/disabled with 'Compare revisions' settings available 
on the configuration page for each content type. 

It also provides a predefined block 'Inline differences' that can be added 
to any layout by using Backdrop's layout administration.

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name, currently version 7.x-3.4.


## Installation
Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
  
    
## Configuration
The main configuration settings can be found at admin/config/content/diff/settings.
These enable additional 'Compare revisions' settings to be found in the 
configuration page for each content type - admin/structure/types.
