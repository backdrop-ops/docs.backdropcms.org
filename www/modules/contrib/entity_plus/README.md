Entity Plus
=================

This module wraps in a variety of entity-related functionality from various
sources, including:

 - The `Entity Metadata Wrapper` module from Drupal 7.
 - Various bits from the `Entity API` module from Drupal 7 which have not (yet)
   been merged into core. Note that this module renames several functions from
   the `entity_xxx()` format to `entity_plus_xxx()` format to prevent conflict
   in case some of these functions are eventually merged into core.

This is an API module. You only need to enable it if a module depends on it or
you are interested in using it for development.
